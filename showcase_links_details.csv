Additionally, the project has a marketplace where user's can buy, sell, or lend their prompts behind their agents. The project also features a bridge for the Agents to use in their investing that relies upon Lit Network for trust less swap of assets on either chain.  The project also has a prediction market where user's can bet on which gladiator that they believe will win the competition.","The project also makes use of Lit protocol for the trust-less execution of cross chain swaps. These work by creating a programmable key pair on each chain that waits until both assets on each chain have been received. When they are received then the lit action can be executed which produces the signed transactions that complete the transfers on both chains. The protocol also makes use of Story Network for the management of the data relevant towards the agents. The prompts that each AI agent has is first registered as an NFT and then onto Story. After the IP is created, then another user is able to mint a license token which they can use to then implement a copy or they can use a derivative to create their own agent. The royalties module was also configured so that the initial creator could receive rewards. A simple lending system was also built on top of this that allowed for a license token holder to lend their license out to any other user.
The prediction market was custom made and deployed to Flow Blockchain, where we used the advantage of them being a consumer focused app."

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/omiswap-b3ma8,https://github.com/raviriley/omitx,"OmiSwap is an innovative platform that simplifies blockchain interactions through voice-activated commands using an AI wearable device. The system allows users to initiate transactions by speaking into their Omi device, recognizing trigger phrases like ""start transaction"" and ""end transaction"" to capture user intent.","How it's made:
OmiSwap is built using a cutting-edge tech stack that combines AI, blockchain, and wearable technology to create a seamless voice-activated crypto transaction platform.
Voice Input and AI Processing:
The system starts with the Omi wearable device, which captures user voice commands. Voice transcripts are sent to our backend, where we use OpenAI's GPT-4 model (via the Red Pill API) to interpret natural language commands into structured transaction intents. We implemented custom prompt engineering to extract specific transaction details like recipient, amount, currency, and network from user utterances.
Backend Architecture:
The core backend is built using Next.js API routes, providing a serverless architecture that scales efficiently. We use TypeScript for type safety and better code maintainability. We also created API routes for webhooks to stream transcription events from the Omi to our backend.
Blockchain Integration:
The heart of our blockchain interactions is the Coinbase CDP (Crypto Development Platform) SDK. This powerful tool allows us to create and manage wallets across multiple networks (Base, Polygon, Arbitrum, Ethereum), execute transfers and swaps, and check balances and transaction statuses. We've implemented support for gasless USDC transfers, leveraging Coinbase Wallet's recent feature update. Multi-chain support is baked into our system, with special emphasis on Polygon & Coinbase for their scalability and low fees.
Database and User Management:
Supabase serves as our primary database, storing user information, wallet data, and transaction logs. We stream data from Supabase through our backend to enable real-time  frontend updates with the latest transaction data.
Frontend:
The user interface is built with Next.js and shadcn/ui, providing a responsive and accessible dashboard for users to view their transactions and wallet balances.
Security:
All sensitive operations, including wallet management and transaction signing, happen server-side to enhance security. We implement proper error handling and input validation to prevent potential exploits.
Innovative Features:
We've created a unique system for extracting transaction intents from natural language using custom regex patterns and AI processing. The integration with the Omi wearable device allows for a truly hands-free crypto experience, bridging the gap between wearable tech and blockchain.
Challenges and Hacks:
One of our biggest challenges was accurately parsing varied user inputs. We implemented a flexible system using regex and AI to handle different phrasings and potential speech-to-text errors. To optimize performance, we parallelized API calls where possible, using Promise.all for concurrent processing of multiple transactions or swaps.
Partner Technologies:
Coinbase CDP SDK: This was crucial for our project, providing a unified interface for multi-chain wallet management and transactions. It significantly reduced the complexity of supporting multiple networks.
Polygon: We leveraged Polygon's fast and cost-effective infrastructure to provide users with an optimal experience for frequent, small-value transactions.
Omi Wearable: This innovative device forms the core of our user interface, enabling voice-activated blockchain interactions in a way that's never been done before.
By combining these technologies, we've created a unique platform that makes blockchain interactions as simple as speaking a command, truly bringing crypto to the masses through the power of AI and wearable tech."

An Oracle is controlled by its creator, starts unresolved, and can become resolved as true or false at any time (but stays resolved once resolved). A Market is not controlled by anyone, but is linked to an Oracle upon creation. When the Market is unresolved, then any user can bet on either the true or false outcome of the Market. When the Oracle resolves, then the Market resolves, and the money bet on the Market is distributed only to the winning bettors. All of this happens only within the contracts system, so no actual tokens are being transferred (that would be for future work). I also made a simplifying assumption that only two bettors (one for true and one for false) can bet on a Market.

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/ethbox-ce3s1,https://github.com/ebchassine/final-ethsf24,"EthBox is a decentralized, secure music distribution platform, designed to tackle file sharing and piracy issues. The music industry has long struggled with piracy and unauthorized file sharing at the peer-to-peer level and within larger circles. Large music labels and streaming services often control rights and distribution, but peer-to-peer sharing, especially among smaller artists, continues to be a problem. For example, DJs often distribute their work on thumb drives, lacking secure and verifiable methods for managing their intellectual property.  EthBox is a specialized Web3 Dropbox for music, offering an encrypted, semi-decentralized file-sharing platform that maintains privacy and authenticity. It integrates with Dynamic for secure login, using a wallet address to authenticate users, ensuring that only trusted users can share and receive files. Artists can upload their music to Weavechain, an in-house API for storing and transporting encrypted files. Each file is signed and associated with a recipient's wallet address, ensuring that only the intended recipient can access the file.  Additionally, audit logs are generated during each read-and-write operation by the Weave node on the storage database.  These logs are stored on Skale Network, a zero-cost, gas-free blockchain platform that allows for scalable and efficient deployment. By writing audit logs on-chain, EthBox ensures verifiable proof of file immutability and lineage, preventing unauthorized tampering and verifying the sender's authenticity through cryptographic methods.","This project is primarily written in javascript, using React for the frontend, using solidity to write the Skale smart contracts.  Python is used to control the development server that hosts the files and the weave node.  We start with Dynamic's login (React) which abstracts Web3 authentication behind a familiar Web2-like interface, which was crucial for onboarding users who might not be familiar with decentralized applications. Each user’s public key is generated through their wallet address, and their actions are signed using cryptographic keys for secure identification.  I used Weavechain's API  (external) to code the backend.  A bit of solidity + java is used to create smart contracts deployed on the Skale network for each operation on the Weave database. Skale’s zero-cost deployment was very helpful in dealing with gas fees, which would have been prohibitively expensive with frequent contract deployments for file tracking and audit logging. Next, looking at the way the public key exchange works, I used the Diffie Hellman pub key exchange."

On other blockchains, trying to split up transactions results in more and more gas fees. If you want to make a trade of $50 across multiple transactions, it is not easily doable. It doesn’t make sense to do 5 $10 trades if gas fees are $5.
The SKALE network’s zero gas features improves the ability to spread out buy and sell orders across multiple transactions because gas costs are no longer a problematic factor.
Our project can be slightly altered to work with any DEX on the network (given the DEX has good documentation). We used a simple “fake DEX” for demonstration purposes.

These regulations, along with growing pressures from big tech companies like Amazon and Apple, are pushing corporations to be more transparent about their emissions and take action to reduce them.
To achieve net-zero emissions, these companies will need to purchase carbon offsets that compensate for the emissions they can't eliminate. However, there is currently a dearth of high-quality carbon credits, and the process of purchasing and managing them can be cumbersome.
The Role of Blockchain:
Blockchain offers a promising solution by enabling dramatic transparency in carbon credit transactions. It allows companies to seamlessly purchase and retire carbon credits, ensuring that these credits are verifiable and traceable. The application your team built aims to address this need by fractionalizing a variety of carbon credits into a single composite token, reducing friction for companies seeking to offset emissions across various projects related to their operations.

The game starts by the user providing a seed which then randomly shuffles all of the cards in a random order. Next, 49 of the shuffled cards are placed in a 7x7 card grid, and then any of the 256 cards are chosen one by one for the player to find. Now, the player must search the board for the singular card they have just been given, and the solution could be between multiple cards or could just be a singular card. Some cards are easier to find than others, that's why we're using a point system based on the complexity of the card. The number of points a card is worth is directly correlated to the amount of colors on that card. For example, if the player gets a card with 3 red squares and 1 blue square, they will receive 2 points for correctly identifying that card on the board, since there are 2 colors (red, blue). The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach 10 points, and once a player reaches 10 they can claim the board. What this means is that if they have successfully reached 10 points, the game will stop and the winning player will be awarded a tradable NFT of the board they were just playing on.",© 2024 ETHGlobal.

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/terraflow-1gvun,https://github.com/SuhaanSyed/TerraFlow,"Terraflow addresses a critical issue in the U.S. agricultural sector: the difficulty farmers face in securing affordable funding to maintain their crops and farmland. With rising interest rates on bank loans and high costs from private investors, farmers are struggling to access the financial support they need. Over the last five years, interest rates for agricultural loans have increased by more than 3.25%, more than doubling the average rates from half a decade ago. This growing financial burden motivated us to create Terraflow, a decentralized web application that aims to provide a more sustainable and community-driven funding solution for farmers.
Terraflow allows farmers to tokenize fractions of their farmland which enables everyday consumers to invest by staking money into these tokenized assets. When consumers stake funds, they contribute to the maintenance and development of the farm, helping farmers access much-needed capital without the high costs associated with traditional financing. In return, consumers receive their stake money back, along with token rewards. These rewards can include exclusive benefits such as early access to farm produce, discounts, or invitations to farm events, creating a mutually beneficial arrangement.
The platform leverages blockchain technology to ensure transparency and security. Each farm listing on Terraflow is represented by smart contracts that govern the terms of investment and staking, allowing users to see the details of the farm, its location, and available investment options. By utilizing fractional ownership, Terraflow enables consumers to invest in local farms, helping them feel that their contribution is meaningful and directly benefiting their community. For farmers, this model reduces dependency on loans and allows them to receive funding at lower effective rates.
Additionally, using data from the USDA NASS and a sample calculation, it is estimated that an average farm in the U.S., which spans about 444 acres, can save approximately $888,000 in maintenance costs by leveraging Terraflow’s community-based funding model. This significant cost reduction can play a crucial role in ensuring the long-term sustainability of farms across the country.
Overall, Terraflow fosters a community-centric approach to agriculture which aims to empower consumers to directly support local farmers while earning rewards. It bridges the gap between Web2 and Web3, making it easy for anyone to participate through user-friendly authentication and embedded wallets, ensuring that even those unfamiliar with blockchain technology can get involved. By connecting consumers and farmers, Terraflow creates a decentralized ecosystem where everyone benefits, promoting growth, sustainability, and resilience in the agricultural sector.","Terraflow integrates advanced blockchain technology and user-friendly design to create a seamless platform where farmers can access essential funding and users can invest in local agriculture. The system begins with Privy which bridges Web2 and Web3 by enabling users to authenticate using their phone number or email.

Property details, such as location, price, and images, are securely stored on IPFS to ensure immutability and accessibility.",How the Project Was Made: The Nitty-Gritty Details
https://ethglobal.com/showcase/the-grid-kxbwq,https://github.com/This-Is-Captain-Code/TheGrid-ETHSF,"This project is a comprehensive 3D model search engine with a unique combination of AI, blockchain, and AR technologies. It offers over 10 million free 3D models available in the widely supported GLB format, sourced from platforms like GitHub, Google, and others, all licensed under Creative Commons. The models are ready to be used in creative projects, with a strong focus on adhering to CC licensing rules to ensure proper attribution and usage rights.
The platform's search engine is designed for 3D creators who want easy access to high-quality assets, with efficient filtering and fast search results. Once a model is chosen, users can mint it as an NFT. The minting process stores the details about 3d model like name etc and also metadata about the artist who originally created the model, ensuring proper recognition for the original creator. This feature is powered by Metaplex Core, a framework that standardizes the metadata for NFTs and makes them compatible across multiple platforms. Each minted NFT carries data of its creator, making it a verifiable digital asset.
In addition to search and minting capabilities, the platform includes an AI-powered feature that integrates with Coinbase's AI wallet. Users can input a prompt, and the AI will suggest three relevant 3D models based on their query. The user is then asked to choose the model that best matches their needs, providing feedback that helps the AI learn and refine its recommendations. In return for their feedback, users are rewarded. This feedback loop enhances the AI's ability to prioritize the most relevant models in future searches, improving the overall search experience for all users.
The project also offers a highly immersive augmented reality (AR) experience, inspired by games like Minecraft Earth and Pokémon GO. Users can explore the real world with their mobile devices, viewing 3D models in AR. These models can be placed in the real world, allowing users to experience them in a more tangible way. Cross platform integration as both mobile and PC players to interact and place 3D models in the AR world. Players can also fetch NFTs they’ve previously minted and place them in the AR world. This gamified interaction with digital assets not only enhances user engagement but also bridges the gap between virtual and physical spaces.
The entire platform is built on blockchain technology, particularly the neon evm and Coinbase blockchain, to ensure decentralized ownership and secure transactions. Users can see and download their digital assets, including their minted NFTs, through their wallets. This combination of AR, blockchain, AI, and creative tools provides a one-stop platform for 3D creators, gamers, and collectors alike, making it a revolutionary tool in the 3D creative community.","The project is built using a variety of cutting-edge technologies that work together to create an advanced, multi-functional platform. Here's a breakdown of how each component fits into the overall structure:
Blockchain Layer: Neon EVM and Metaplex Core
•	Neon EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) allows for the deployment of Ethereum smart contracts on the Solana blockchain. By using Neon, the project can leverage Solana’s high-speed, low-cost transactions while maintaining compatibility with Ethereum's robust developer ecosystem. This is crucial for managing the NFT minting process efficiently and cost-effectively.
•	Metaplex Core is used for minting the NFTs. It simplifies the process of creating NFTs by standardizing metadata storage and enabling seamless interaction with various platforms. Metaplex ensures that when users mint a 3D model as an NFT, the metadata for the artist, is embedded into the token.
AI Integration: Coinbase AI Wallet
•	Coinbase AI wallet is integrated to provide AI-powered 3D model recommendations. Users enter a prompt, and the AI suggests three models based on the input. After users select the most relevant model, they provide feedback that enhances the AI’s future performance. This creates a continuous loop of improvement for the search functionality and rewards users for their engagement.
Web Search Engine: AWS EC2 and Three.js
•	The AWS EC2 instance serves as the backbone for the search engine, managing the large volume of 3D models (10 million+). AWS EC2 was chosen for its scalability and reliability, ensuring fast search results and uninterrupted service.
Augmented Reality: Google Geospatial Creator and Unity 3D
•	Google Geospatial Creator enables the AR functionality of the platform. It leverages Google’s extensive location-based data to create realistic, geo-referenced AR experiences. This feature is key to allowing users to place 3D models in real-world locations, similar to games like Pokémon GO or Minecraft Earth.
•	Unity 3D powers the AR game aspect, allowing users to interact with their minted NFTs in a virtual version of the real world. Unity’s robust AR development tools, combined with Google Geospatial, provide an immersive, location-based experience where users can see and manipulate 3D models in real time.
Frontend: HTML, CSS and threejs
•	The HTML, CSS and threejs framework is used for the frontend interface, ensuring a clean, responsive design that makes the platform accessible across multiple devices. It provides users with an intuitive experience when searching for models, and engaging with AR content.
Notable Hacks
•	A notable hack is the integration of Neon EVM to use Solana's blockchain with Ethereum compatibility. This allows the project to benefit from Solana’s speed and low fees while maintaining the broader Ethereum ecosystem, which opens up additional possibilities for future integrations.
•	Another unique feature is the AI feedback loop with the Coinbase AI wallet. By encouraging users to select the best models from AI suggestions and rewarding them for their feedback, the system not only personalizes search results but also improves the model ranking algorithm over time."

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/agi-pivot-swzoo,https://github.com/Helton-AI/PIVOT,"The main goal of the project is to address the issue of decentralized storage for AGI model data in the future. We have visually displayed the storage nodes on the left side of the website, while the right side is the file upload area. Once a local file is uploaded, the content just uploaded can be seen in the visual representation of decentralized nodes on the left side. The platform supports the upload of any file type. To make the demo more intuitive, the button text and video demonstration currently use image uploads.","The project uses the Next.js framework, with the left side featuring a complex block node network topology implemented through logical algorithms and CSS3 keyframe animations. The right side utilizes the decentralized infrastructure provided by Walrus, primarily functioning as an API gateway. When a file or image is uploaded and the upload button is clicked, the Next.js client component's form triggers an action that submits the form content to the Next.js server. The server then requests the Walrus API gateway, specifically the WalrusPublisherUrl. Upon successful invocation, the uploaded content is stored in the Walrus decentralized node network, and storage information is returned, including blobId, endEpoch, txDigest, and blobObjectId. To display or download the file content, especially for images, the WalrusAggregatorUrl can be used by appending /v1/ and the blobId to create a retrieval URL. The Next.js server maintains a dataList array in cookies to temporarily store the returned storage information, caching it on the client side. This way, after a successful upload or page refresh, the left-side block node network topology can immediately call the Next.js server's getDataList method to fetch the latest and historical file storage information, triggering a re-render of the front-end components to update the UI."
https://ethglobal.com/showcase/unihook-ujo6v,https://github.com/Attens1423/market-maker-hook,"The current market makers built upon Uniswap V4 have the problem of not knowing a better quote from outside. Besides, without a hook, users cannot put a limit order for trade on Uniswap. We went through the implementation of the limit order hook and found that it doesn’t process the spread issue, which may also lead to imprecise quotes. Based on these insights, we create a Market Maker Hook, which aims to extend a real case based upon Aggregator Hook – MatchEngine is used to maintain the order book provided by different Market Makers. Aggregator Hook projects quotes from the external market makers and offers a better quote with little difference by calculating the exact tick given deltaX and deltaY. When a user initiates a transaction, the Aggregator Hook adds liquidity into an empty pool, allowing users to leverage the better quote from the order book directly. This design resolves the need for limited orders and allows Market Maker to integrate seamlessly into Uniswap V4.","We use Uniswap V4 Hook and Framework. It introduces a powerful and flexible way to extend the functionality of Uniswap's decentralized exchange. With hooks, developers can customize and optimize various aspects of liquidity pools, such as executing trades, managing fees, and integrating external data, allowing for a more versatile and efficient trading experience on the platform. We create a hook based on the framework to map LP positions from various DEXs to Uniswap ticks effectively using Solidity.

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/rupabase-aa4xc,https://github.com/MDG-ETHSingapore-2024,"Rupabase is a web3 backend as a service platform through which web3 developers can spin up database instances and abstracts away their management by providing a set of solidity methods to call to interact with the instances. This way developers get a multi purpose database which their dApps can access from anywhere - the frontend, smart contracts or any other backend involved.
Project owners can add other smart contracts/wallets as having all permissions except creating databases, enabling access to the same database to different dApps on the same chain.
Rupabase's architecture allows for ZERO EFFORT cross chain interoperability as the project owners just need to connect their wallet on a network to the admin portal frontend to get authorized on that chain and multiple dApps on same/different chains can access databases by calling chain-independent code.
Rupabase doesn't stop here. By using data availability layers and rollups, we can enable on-chain databases for both on chain as well as off chain usage. Novel and community helping projects that can be made using Rupabase include a web3 based Machine Learning dataset collection platform, where different users initialize datasets, getting full control over that dataset and allowing others to put in more data. This will save huge time for researchers and engineers alike who otherwise have to scan through the internet, gathering different datasets uploaded by different users, combining them themselves.

React with TypeScript (TSX):
Why: React provides a robust framework for building dynamic user interfaces, while TypeScript adds type safety, reducing runtime errors and improving code maintainability.
Integration: The frontend handles user interactions, such as highlighting text to generate private tags. It uses local storage to temporarily store these tags, ensuring they remain on the user's device for privacy.
Backend Development:
Node.js:
Why: Node.js is well-suited for building scalable network applications. Its non-blocking I/O model makes it efficient for handling multiple requests, which is crucial for a platform with potentially high traffic.
Integration: The backend processes generic tags and interacts with blockchain components. It receives data from the frontend, analyzes it, and matches ads using the information from the blockchain.
Blockchain and Decentralization:
Mina Protocol:
Overview: Mina Protocol is known for its succinct blockchain, which is designed to remain lightweight and efficient. Unlike traditional blockchains that grow in size over time, Mina maintains a constant size, making it highly scalable and accessible.
Integration in Your Project:
Transaction Handling: Mina is used to record transactions related to ad placements, payments, and user interactions. This ensures that all transactions are transparent and verifiable without the overhead of a large blockchain.
Data Verification: The succinct nature of Mina allows for efficient data verification. This is crucial for ensuring the integrity of ad-related data, such as impressions and clicks, without requiring extensive computational resources.
Smart Contracts: Mina supports smart contracts, which can be used to automate processes like ad bidding, revenue sharing, and governance decisions. These contracts are executed on the blockchain, ensuring they are tamper-proof and transparent.
The Graph:
Overview: The Graph is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying blockchain data. It allows developers to build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, that applications can query using GraphQL.
Integration in Your Project:
Data Indexing: The Graph indexes data from Mina Protocol's smart contracts, making it easily accessible for the backend to query. This is essential for retrieving information about ad transactions, user interactions, and other relevant data.
Efficient Querying: By using The Graph, your platform can perform complex queries on blockchain data quickly and efficiently. This enables real-time analytics and ad targeting based on up-to-date information.
Subgraph Development: Custom subgraphs can be developed to cater to specific data needs of your platform, such as tracking ad performance metrics or user engagement statistics.
Decentralized Storage:
Overview: Decentralized storage solutions like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) are used to store ad content and metadata. This ensures that data is distributed across a network of nodes, rather than being held by a single entity.
Integration in Your Project:
Ad Content Storage: Ad images, descriptions, and other media are stored on IPFS. This ensures that the content is always available and not subject to censorship or single-point failures.
Data Integrity: IPFS provides content-addressable storage, meaning that each piece of data is identified by a unique hash. This ensures that the data has not been tampered with and remains consistent across the network.
Access and Retrieval: The frontend and backend can retrieve ad content from IPFS using these hashes, ensuring that the data is always up-to-date and accessible.
Governance with AirDAO:
Overview: AirDAO provides a framework for decentralized governance, allowing stakeholders to participate in decision-making processes related to the platform.
Integration in Your Project:
Community Voting: AirDAO can facilitate voting on platform changes, such as feature updates or policy adjustments. This ensures that the platform evolves in a way that reflects the community's interests.
Proposal Management: Stakeholders can submit proposals for new features or changes, which are then voted on by the community. This decentralized approach ensures transparency and inclusivity in governance.
Partner Technologies and Benefits
Worldcoin ID and AirDAO: These technologies enhance user privacy and platform governance, respectively. Worldcoin ID allows for secure user identification without compromising privacy, while AirDAO ensures that the platform's evolution is guided by its community.
Mina Protocol and The Graph: These technologies provide a scalable and efficient way to handle blockchain data, ensuring that the platform can grow without performance bottlenecks."

Through this collaboration, Web3 protocols can offer airdrops or other incentives to early adopters from the Web2 world, effectively bridging the gap between these two digital realms.
This strategy not only helps Web3 protocols to acquire and retain a broader user base but also provides value to Web2 platforms by incentivizing their users to engage with blockchain technology. As users from Web2 platforms are rewarded for their participation, they're more likely to remain active on both the Web2 platform and the partnered Web3 protocol.

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/whodis-0d13u,https://github.com/MikePawel/ethglobal-singapore-24,"Our project focuses on retrieving and analyzing transaction history data of a NEAR blockchain address. This process begins by fetching the wallet's transaction history, capturing all incoming and outgoing activities, such as transfers, token swaps, and other on-chain events. Once this data is collected, we extract a list of all other wallet addresses involved in the transactions, and fetch metadata about each address, like whether it's a smart contract, if it belongs to a known Dapp, and if it does, then to which category does that project belong (DeFi, NFT, tooling...).
After fetching all required data, we pass it to an LLM (in this case: gpt-4o) to systematically analyze the transactions and identify patterns, and behaviors that reflect the user's activities and interests. This enables us to generate a detailed description that accurately characterizes the user or wallet's primary activities, such as whether they are involved in frequent trading, liquidity providing, participating in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, or any other blockchain-based activity.

Project Overview:
ZkScholar is a decentralized platform that transforms the way financial aid is distributed to students. Built on blockchain technology, the platform employs zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) to ensure that students can apply for financial aid securely, while their personal and financial information remains completely private. By integrating World ID for identity verification and Mina Protocol for privacy-preserving computations, ZkScholar eliminates the inefficiencies, privacy concerns, and security risks associated with traditional financial aid systems.
The platform also leverages Circle's USDC to provide near-instant, conditional disbursements to students' wallets. With a fully on-chain process, ZkScholar ensures transparency and accuracy in the management and distribution of student aid funds while protecting user data.
Problem:
Each year, over $250 billion in financial aid is distributed to students through outdated, bureaucratic systems that are slow, cumbersome, and insecure. Students must submit sensitive personal and financial information to multiple institutions, risking data breaches. Additionally, the process for determining aid eligibility is often slow, and disbursement of funds can be delayed, affecting students’ ability to manage their finances and continue their education.
Solution:
ZkScholar introduces a streamlined, fast, and private way for students to apply for financial aid. Using zk-SNARKs technology, the platform allows students to submit proof of financial need without revealing sensitive data. Colleges can set financial aid criteria, and the platform uses zero-knowledge proofs to match students with qualifying financial aid options without exposing personal information.
ZkScholar ensures a transparent yet private verification process where:
Colleges set their aid criteria using a simple UI, and can only see anonymized results of student eligibility.
Students submit their financial data through a privacy-preserving mechanism and receive feedback on their aid eligibility in real time.
How it Works:
Colleges Set Aid Criteria: Colleges log into ZkScholar using World ID for secure authentication. They then define their financial aid criteria, which can include financial need, academic performance, geographic location, or other custom factors.","For ZkScholar's frontend, we used Material UI and typescript. For our login process, we used Worldcoin's World IDs for decentralized and secure identity verification. Following that, we made stored and queries on-chain data on Mina Protocol using Protokit, which served as the backend and database for ZkScholar's application. After USDC is disbursed, we want to provide a seamless process to convert USDC tokens to fiat through our smart-routing protocol that quickly identifies and pieces together the best conversion route across all decentralized apps. The smart contract that simulated the swap was deployed on Ethereum Sepolia using nodes from Infura, and we deployed the contract using Hardhat.

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/apey-fi-72in3,https://github.com/ABusyHippie/ETHGlobalSingapore,APEY is a perpetual trading protocol for APY (Annual Percentage Yield). We built a decentralized financial system enabling users to trade perpetual contracts (derivatives without an expiration date) based on APY rates of various financial instruments. Here’s a breakdown of how this protocol works:,"The front end is mostly built on the “main” branch which is a dashboard displaying the current Lido APY along with long and short buttons with a leverage slider for users to be able to bet on whether that APY will go up or down over time as a perpetual derivative
The Lido APY is pulled using a Rust program (src/main.rs) that pulls the data from a Lido API and simulates a trusted oracle providing the data but in our case is just signed by our deploying wallet to push the data into the smart contract (deployed in Remix, “backend” branch:/contracts/LidoAPYPerpetual.sol)
The data then gets pushed on init (cargo run) which calls the updateAPY function in the smart contract and listens on a heartbeat every 5 seconds
This smart contract allows users to take perpetual, leveraged positions on whether the Lido APY increases or decreases, using RBTC as the financial instrument at stake in order to utilize the largest asset in crypto giving it exposure to a new financial derivative based on one of the largest TVL protocols in the world
For communicating the state of the smart contract to the front end, we deployed a subgraph that can reference the underlying APY data from and use it to push the user requests for derivative trading to the smart contract"

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/story-chain-d4r02,https://github.com/khairultruestory/StoryChain,"StoryChain is an innovative blockchain-powered marketplace that revolutionizes the way authors publish, own, and monetize their literary works while providing readers with a transparent and engaging platform to discover and support their favorite writers.
At its core, StoryChain leverages blockchain technology to create a decentralized ecosystem that addresses key challenges in the traditional publishing industry. Each story or book published on the platform is minted as a unique non-fungible token (NFT), establishing clear and indisputable ownership rights for the author. This blockchain-based ownership model ensures that creators retain full control over their intellectual property while providing an immutable record of publication dates and authorship.
The platform's user-friendly interface allows authors to easily upload their works, input metadata, and mint their stories as NFTs. To publish, authors pay a gas fee, which not only covers the blockchain transaction costs but also serves as proof of ownership. StoryChain provides clear explanations of these fees and the associated benefits, ensuring authors understand the value of blockchain-based ownership.
For readers, StoryChain offers a rich library of diverse content across various genres. The platform's intuitive discovery features, including advanced search functionality and genre-based browsing, make it easy for readers to find new and exciting stories. A seamless reading interface enhances the user experience, allowing readers to immerse themselves in their chosen works.
One of StoryChain's standout features is its direct donation mechanism. Readers can support authors they appreciate by making cryptocurrency or traditional currency donations directly through the platform. This system bypasses traditional intermediaries, ensuring that a higher percentage of the contribution reaches the author. The platform provides transparency by displaying donation amounts received by each author, fostering a sense of community and direct support between readers and writers.
StoryChain takes a proactive approach to protecting intellectual property rights. The platform incorporates a sophisticated plagiarism prevention system that utilizes blockchain timestamps and content hashing. Each new submission is cross-referenced against existing blockchain records, making it virtually impossible for plagiarized content to be published under a different author's name.
Security and transparency are paramount in StoryChain's design. The decentralized nature of blockchain technology ensures high levels of security for both transactions and data storage. All blockchain-related actions, including ownership transfers, donations, and publication records, are easily accessible and verifiable by users, promoting trust and accountability within the community.
The platform also features separate dashboards for authors and readers. Authors can track their publications, view real-time analytics on readership and donations, and manage their earnings. Readers can curate their library, manage their donation history, and engage with their favorite authors.
To aid user adoption, StoryChain provides comprehensive documentation, including user guides and FAQs that explain blockchain concepts, gas fees, and platform usage in accessible language. This educational aspect helps bridge the gap between traditional publishing and the Web3 ecosystem.
Looking to the future, StoryChain plans to introduce additional features such as a native token economy to incentivize participation, expanded blockchain integration for faster and cheaper transactions, and enhanced social features to build a thriving community of writers and readers.
By combining the security and transparency of blockchain technology with a user-friendly interface and direct support mechanisms, StoryChain aims to empower authors, delight readers, and usher in a new era of digital literature where creativity is fairly rewarded and intellectual property is securely protected.",This project uses scaffold-eth as a project template.

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/fill-me-up-9u13c,https://github.com/pauldev20/fillmeup,"Gas cost is annoying!
You need to maintain gas on every chain you interact with, and eventually, you'll run out on some of them.
With this project, you can approve funds on a single chain. Whenever you're low on gas on any chain, your balance will automatically be filled up using those approved funds. This ensures you only spend the minimum necessary to keep just enough gas on all chains, saving you from the hassle of manual refills.","This project utilizes an intermediary contract to which users approve their funds.
A central service monitors the gas levels of users who have approved funds. When a user's gas is low, the service calls the intermediary contract, which uses the approved allowance to transfer some funds to itself. It then swaps and bridges the funds to the chain that is running low.
Since the contract can only transfer funds to the same user address on another chain, users maintain complete control and security, with no risk of losing their assets."

Next.js: Chosen for its robust server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities and streamlined routing.
Walrus: A decentralized storage service and SDK that facilitated efficient data handling in our application.
Dynamic: An incredibly straightforward library that made setup a breeze and greatly enhanced the development experience.
Story: A powerful technology with some complexities, but with perseverance, we managed to build a solid use case.
Web3 & Blockchain: Essential for enabling decentralized features and enhancing security.
Integration of Partner Technologies
Dynamic: Setting up Dynamic was super easy, making it a fantastic addition to our stack. Its simplicity allowed us to focus on building features rather than wrestling with complex configurations.
Story: While Story presented some challenges, with persistence, we navigated its complexities and extracted a solid build. It proved to be a very powerful technology, and I can see myself leveraging it in future projects.
Walrus: Walrus was an excellent choice as a decentralized storage solution. Once I navigated the initial dense documentation, integrating it into our project was straightforward. While the documentation could be more approachable, the SDK’s capabilities were impressive, and I’d recommend enhancing the docs for better accessibility.
Notable Hacky Solutions
Building anything in 36 hours is inherently challenging, and our project ended up being a collection of quick fixes and workarounds.

This project combines the power of web scraping, real-time messaging, and price comparison to provide users with a seamless and efficient shopping experience.
Key Features and Functionality:
Amazon Product Tracking:
Users can input any Amazon product URL into the system. The application then utilizes Selenium WebDriver to scrape essential product information, including the product name, current price, and image.
Real-time Display:
The scraped information is immediately displayed on the web interface, giving users instant access to the product details they're interested in.
3. XMTP Integration:
One of the standout features of PriceAlert is its integration with XMTP (Extensible Message Transport Protocol). This allows the system to send real-time alerts and updates directly to users.
Price Alerts:
The system sends an initial message via XMTP containing the product details and current price. This sets up the foundation for future price drop alerts.
Walmart Price Comparison:
To provide users with more options, PriceAlert automatically generates a Walmart search link for the same product. After a short delay (10 seconds in the current implementation), it sends a follow-up XMTP message with this link, encouraging users to compare prices across platforms.
User-Friendly Interface:
The web interface, built with Flask, offers a clean and intuitive design. Users can easily input URLs, view product information, and understand the alerts they'll receive.
Scalable Architecture:
The project is split into two main components - a Flask server (app.py) for handling web requests and scraping, and a Node.js server (xmtp_service.js) for XMTP messaging. This separation of concerns allows for easier scaling and maintenance.
Technical Implementation:
The Flask server (app.py) handles the web interface and Amazon scraping. It uses Selenium for dynamic web scraping, ensuring accurate and up-to-date product information.
The Node.js server (xmtp_service.js) manages all XMTP communications. It creates random wallets for each message, ensuring user privacy and system flexibility.
The project leverages the power of both Python and JavaScript, showcasing the ability to integrate different technologies for optimal performance.

In this system, users can create two types of intents: borrower and lender intents.A borrow intent represents a user's desire to secure a loan by offering an NFT as collateral. A lender intent, on the other hand, reflects a lender's willingness to provide cryptocurrency. These user-signed intents encapsulate their desired outcomes in a secure, single transaction.A solver mechanism matches borrower and lender intents based on predefined compatibility criteria. Once matched, the NFT provided by the borrower is held as collateral, while the lender supplies the agreed-upon cryptocurrency to the borrower.If the borrower fails to repay the principal amount along with the interest within the specified period, the lender has the right to claim ownership of the collateralized NFT. However, if the borrower completes the repayment within the agreed timeframe, the loan is fulfilled, and both intents are marked as completed. Our interest strategy is limit order and once solution is made we use the lower interest which is by the lender.LoanIntent enhances the flexibility and transparency of lending in the DeFi ecosystem, providing secure mechanisms for both parties in a transaction.","Our project is based on EIP ERC 7521, introducing the concept of intents where users can create intents in the mempool, and a solver attempts to satisfy these intents based on predefined compatibility criteria.

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/pool-33bxn,https://github.com/HussamX98/Pool,"We created Pool as a way to allow anyone to easily share common expenses together in a fun, easy, and simple way. Our idea is to have non-crypto native people utilize the benefits of blockchain without evening knowing they’re using crypto. As respected figured in the community say: “Bring blockchain to people, not people to blockchain”.
To be honest, we’ve seen many ideas/products with a somewhat similar idea. However, it felt lacking in one way or another. Many apps offer payments or calculations alone, none that offer both. We are trying to solve this with pool in a fun and gamified experience.
Web3Auth is used for users to easily login with any web2 method and this will create a wallet for them behind the scenes.
Money will first be deposited into the pool by each member and a shared crypto wallet will be generated for the members of this specific pool to have access to. When the USD is deposited from the bank account( using chainlink functions that calls the plaid api), it is converted to USDC in that pool’s wallet. Members can use apple pay to pay for anything the way they would normally pay for stuff when purchasing items. The fact that apple is allowing third party apps to utilize their NFC technology for apple pay is significant. This means that people can use our built in crypto wallet to pay for real life purchases through apple pay, alongside samsung/google pay.  Again, all this is done behind the scenes, which means that the users isn’t dealing with anything crypto-related.
Each purchase made by any member will be posted in the pool and deducted from the total pooled amount. That way it’s equally deducted from everyone and simplifies the process greatly. If there’s some money remaining in the pool after the trip or whatever the activity, it’ll be equally split by the amount of users and the user can choose to keep their share in the app (their wallet) or withdraw back to their bank account.
Layerzero is our choice of deployment. It offers us all the security, freedom, and ease we could ask for. We don’t have to fully commit to a single blockchain and can utilize multiple easily. We will also make use of the gas fee estimator from Layerzero to help with calculating the micro fee that’ll be taken from each transaction as well as select the best USEC network to swap into and from at different times to make it as cheap as possible for the user by routing the swap through the network that has the lowest gas fee.
We will integrate an in-app economy that incentives members to benefit the rest of the members. Actions like running the errands and making the necessary purchases are examples that can get members rewarded with tokens. These tokens could have many use cases, one of which is using them like in-game money to buy extras or show off trophies. Having the ability to have these tokens on different blockchains will only be beneficial.
Thank you very much and see you at the POOL party!","We used next.js as the main framework and incorporated the Aceternity UI to provide the gamified feel. We used chainlink functions to call the plaid API to securely connect a bank account.

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/surebuy-apy1o,https://github.com/SiddharthaMadhav/ETHOnline-Frontend,"In today’s digital economy, trust is paramount in online marketplaces. Buyers frequently encounter the risk of purchasing counterfeit or unauthorized products, leading to significant concerns about product authenticity. Many platforms allow vendors to sell items under a manufacturer’s name, yet these vendors may not be authorized to do so, often offering duplicate products that do not originate from the manufacturer.
This project seeks to revolutionize the online marketplace by creating a secure platform where sellers can only offer products that have been verified and attested by the respective manufacturers. By implementing a robust attestation system, we aim to eliminate unauthorized vendors and ensure that all products listed in the marketplace are 100% authentic and authorized.
Vendors must obtain attestation from manufacturers before listing their products. This ensures that only authorized sellers can market items under a manufacturer’s name. Vendors can submit requests for attestation to multiple manufacturers. Manufacturers have the authority to accept or decline these requests, maintaining control over their brand’s representation.
The attestation process is facilitated by leveraging the Sign Protocol, which allows for on-chain verification of seller attestations. This decentralized approach eliminates the need for a central authority, significantly reducing the risk of fraud and manipulation.
By uniting buyers, vendors, and manufacturers on a single, trustworthy platform, this project aims to redefine the online shopping experience. With a focus on authenticity and security, we are committed to creating a marketplace where trust is not just an option, but a guarantee.","The project's smart contracts are deployed on the Sepolia testnet and consist of two primary components: SureBuy and SureBuyMP. The SureBuy smart contract serves as a bridge between vendors and manufacturers, enabling them to register on the platform. Vendors can send requests for attestation to manufacturers, who can then accept or decline these requests. Additionally, SureBuy interacts with the Sign Protocol smart contract on Sepolia to facilitate secure attestations. The SureBuyMP contract functions as the marketplace interface, connecting verified vendors with buyers. Only vendors who have received attestation from manufacturers are permitted to sell their products in the marketplace, ensuring that all items available for purchase are legitimate.

The smart contract, written in Solidity, handles user profiles and matching logic using FHE operations provided by the Fhenix protocol. This allows for encrypted profile data and private matching computations. The frontend is developed with React and uses ethers.js for Ethereum interactions and fhenixjs for FHE operations. The app allows users to create encrypted profiles with details like age, gender, location, and preferences. It then performs matches based on these encrypted attributes without revealing the actual data. The matching process emits events that are captured by the frontend to display matches to users.
The solidity contract full of fhe was deployed on remix.
I used the fhenix docs mainly, their ai chat bot was nice, although did hallucinate a little which led me down some dead ends, and I had a hardtime getting enough testnet tokens due to trying to compute to much and so ending up testing contracts with very high gas.

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/skillset-5hgqf,https://github.com/atLiandri/SkillSet,"The project makes use of Sign protocol to register skill certificates. User A can submit a certificate proposal to B, and B can then decide to approve the certificate. The proposal contains a description of the attested skill, together with a level in that skill. If B accepts the proposal, an attestation is created using Sign protocol. This allows B to have control on her attestations portfolio.
We also implemented a Sign protocol schema hook that enables the admin to set an approval cooldown. The cooldown is a certain amount of time that any user has to wait between a proposal approval and the other. A higher cooldown means that on average the certifications registered at the schema will have a higher relevance, since the cooldown imposes users to approve only the most relevant proposals among those they received.
Submitted proposals can be invalidated by the issuer,","The smart contract level of the project is composed by a main contract that the frontend interacts with, and by a schema hook contract. Via the main contract proposals can be submitted and approved. When an attestation is approved, a third contract implementing the Sign interface (not deployed by us) is called to actually register the attestation. That contract then calls a Sign schema (created by us via the Sign web app) which is attached to the custom hook we created.

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/crossflow-ypb07,https://github.com/S03XY/crossflow-lz-contracts,"CrossFlow offers a seamless, user-friendly experience by enabling users to generate a memorable and unique domain that is directly mapped to their wallet. This domain serves as an omnichain identifier, reserved exclusively for the user across all supported blockchains, even if certain chains are not yet activated. This feature simplifies the process for users, ensuring that their domain is always available and easy to recall.
With CrossFlow, users can effortlessly transfer tokens across different blockchains from any chain they are currently on. For instance, if a user wishes to transfer 1 USDC from Sepolia to Hedera, they simply need to input their domain. The system will automatically verify the wallet associated with the domain, allowing the user to select the destination chain and specify the amount to transfer. The entire process is handled by the system, ensuring a smooth and efficient transaction.
To further enhance user convenience, we are integrating QR-based payment options, making it even easier to initiate transfers. Additionally, a confirmation bot built on XTMP will notify the recipient of the transaction. For example, if someone sends you 1 USDC, the bot will instantly notify you with a message stating that 1 USDC has been received. You can then verify this transaction using the Converse application.
This comprehensive approach not only streamlines cross-chain transfers but also provides users with a robust and intuitive payment experience, ensuring that every transaction is as simple and secure as possible.","This project leverages a robust tech stack comprising Next.js for the frontend, NestJS for the backend, and MongoDB for efficient database indexing. For cross-chain token transfers, the project integrates with the LayerZero network, ensuring seamless interoperability across different blockchains. Additionally, an XMTP bot is employed to automatically notify recipients of payments directly in their decentralized wallets, providing instant and secure transaction confirmations.
The development process is managed using Hardhat, with smart contracts deployed and configured through LayerZero tasks. Users interact with these contracts for tasks such as registration and token transfers.
The registration process begins when a user expresses intent by paying a small fee set by the contract administrator. This triggers a call to the registration contract, reserving the user’s unique identity. Our system acts as a middleware to ensure that each identity is unique—once an identity is reserved based on the user’s intent, it becomes unavailable to others.
After successfully reserving a domain name, users can transfer stablecoins across any supported blockchain via the LayerZero protocol. Upon successful completion of a transfer, the recipient is automatically notified through the XMTP protocol, ensuring they are promptly informed that the tokens have been received.
This comprehensive solution not only secures unique identities across chains but also facilitates efficient and reliable cross-chain token transfers, backed by real-time notifications."

Because this is all just a test environment, you’ll notice that this also uses Metamask – that’s how we connect to the Sepolia testnet for minting of these “test” NFTs for now. In a production environment, there’d be no requirement to connect two wallets.
The backend is using Node.js and Moralis. The Moralis API gives us easy access to the NFTs that a user has associated with their wallet that they connect via the frontend. We parse through these, making sure that only DIMO NFTs end up in the application, and filter through these based on a user's vehicleID so that, if a user has multiple vehicles on the network, we can correspond the NFT image with that unique vehicle.
We also created a very basic smart contract in Solidity, which was deployed to the Sepolia testnet via the Remix IDE. The contract uses OpenZeppelin with a simple mintNFT function. We then use ethers.js in our React application to handle the minting of the “rental contract” NFTs. As a fun aside, we also used ethers.js and Infura.io to support ENS for the “Drivers Wallet” input field – so instead of having to type out a users full 0x address, you can simply input “vitalik.eth” and have that ENS be resolved to the full address.

It's all about onboarding the next wave of crypto users with ease and simplicity!","We built ZeroWallet by starting with a Safe smart account, fully compatible with the ERC-4337 spec, ensuring smooth gas and account abstraction. The onboarding process is simple and secure, using a passkey module that complies with ERC-7579, allowing users to skip the hassle of complicated wallet setups. Once onboarded, users can create an automatic investment strategy using a Session Key module and a DCA investment module. This includes seamless integration with Uniswap contracts for executing trades and ERC-4626 Vault contracts for managing assets.
To keep things running smoothly, we’ve designed a scheduler service that uses a REST API to trigger jobs for each user’s investment strategy. The scheduler ensures recurring investments are handled without any manual intervention. For added convenience, we integrated Zapper API, making it easy for users to access and monitor their portfolios in real time.
The real magic happens with LayerZero, where we’ve implemented chain abstraction. Through integration with ERC-4626 vaults and OFT (Omnichain Fungible Token) contracts, users can withdraw their funds across any network, making cross-chain management simple and intuitive. This powerful combination ensures ZeroWallet delivers a seamless, next-gen experience for crypto users everywhere."

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/the-entropy-protocol-dwa3d,https://github.com/Ashy5000/entropy_protocol,"The Entropy Protocol is an onchain decentralized randomness solution designed to replace oracle-based randomness generation. It combines contributions of randomness from 'entropy providers' that is supplied to 'entropy consumers' that use the random data. Consumers can mix randomness from multiple providers using their choice of method to add extra security to the protocol. Providers have to make 'commits' to randomness ahead of time, when they don't know what the other data in the pool is, so they can't manipulate the end result. These features ensure that randomness is entirely unpredictable to all parties involved.","For the smart contracts, we used Sign Protocol to handle attestations entropy providers make to provide randomness at some later date. We leveraged the Schema Hooks feature to automatically trigger logic when new commits are made. Sign Protocol was an incredible addition to our tech stack, as it allowed for standardized interfaces that could enable interoperability with the protocol. For the protocol's token, ENTP, we utilized OpenZeppelin Contracts for ERC20 implementations and interfaces. And to test, deploy, and interact with the contracts via scripts, we used the Hardhat Javascript library."

They start with a default amount of calories for their pet. The typing game is the core activity, where users play to earn calories for their pet by correctly typing words. Different difficulty levels or game modes offer varying caloric rewards. Users can monitor their pet's status on a virtual dashboard and must feed their pet 120 calories every 24 hours to keep it alive. The pet has a lifecycle, and if it doesn't receive the required calories within the timeframe, it ""dies."" Users can earn rewards or achievements for keeping their pet alive for extended periods, adding a challenge and incentive to the game.","Chainlink: Helps to bring data from soccerapi to our contract deployed on the Polygon Maumbai.
Chainlink aced as a bridge between smart contracts and external soccerapi(Oracles). Oracles retrieve and verify data from various sources, such as APIs, web services, or IoT devices, and feed it into the smart contracts. This allows our smart contracts to get the official resuls of the game and allows to reward the winner.
We also deployed a Chainlink Automation Job Scheduler"
https://ethglobal.com/showcase/social-tokens-mk7f0,https://github.com/0xale/SocialTokens,"Our platform empowers users to create and manage social tokens through an innovative bonding curve mechanism. This dynamic pricing model ensures that as more tokens are issued and the number of Farcaster followers grows, the value of each token rises accordingly. To further enhance user engagement, our system mints additional bonus tokens using Pyth Oracel, which generates random percentages based on the ETH/USD Price Feed. This approach not only incentivizes participation but also continuously increases the token’s value as the platform expands. By leveraging these features, new platforms can effectively generate tokens, drive user engagement, and benefit from a growth-driven pricing structure.","We use Solidity and Foundry for smart contract development and testing. For data and randomization, we rely on the Pyth Oracle to generate random percentages and provide user bonuses. To fetch user counWe use Solidity and Foundry for developing and testing our smart contracts, ensuring robust and reliable code. For data and randomization, we rely on the Pyth Oracle to generate random percentages, which are then used to provide bonuses to users.
